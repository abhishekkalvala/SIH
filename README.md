# Smart India Hackathon 2025: IoT & AI-Enabled Skill Training Equipment Monitoring

This repository contains the official source code and documentation for our team's submission to the Smart India Hackathon 2025.

ðŸš€ The Problem Statement
IoT & AI-Enabled Skill Training Equipment Monitoring

Modern vocational and skill training centers use expensive, complex equipment. However, tracking the usage, performance, and maintenance needs of this equipment is often manual, inefficient, and lacks real-time data. This leads to equipment downtime, poor training feedback, and inefficient resource management.

ðŸ’¡ Our Solution
Our project provides a smart, integrated system that uses the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to monitor skill training equipment in real-time.

We bridge the gap between physical hardware and digital analytics by:
1.  Attaching *IoT sensors* to equipment to capture live data (e.g., usage time, operational parameters, error codes).
2.  Streaming this data to a central cloud platform.
3.  Using *AI models* to analyze the data, predict maintenance needs, track trainee performance, and provide actionable insights via a simple dashboard.

âœ¨ Key Features
  Real-Time Monitoring: A live dashboard for administrators to see the status of all equipment.
  Predictive Maintenance: AI-powered alerts that warn of potential equipment failure before it happens.
  Trainee Analytics: Track how individual trainees are using the equipment, helping instructors provide personalized feedback.
  Resource Optimization: Identify underutilized or overused equipment to optimize scheduling and procurement.
  Automated Reporting: Generate reports on equipment health, usage, and trainee progress.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
  Hardware: [e.g., Raspberry Pi, ESP32, specific sensors like current sensors, temperature sensors]
  IoT Platform: [e.g., AWS IoT Core, Azure IoT Hub, ThingsSpeak]
  Database: [e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase]
  Backend: [e.g., Python (Flask/Django), Node.js]
  Frontend (Dashboard): [e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js]
  AI/ML: [e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn for predictive models]
